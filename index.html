	<h1>Data:</h1>
    <h2>This is where you can find different types of data spread all across different and newer colleges.</h2>
	<p>Some of the data was shown from an update in 2024, that 2/3th of first-year students, end up dropping out, due to the insane
	pricing of colleges, not only from around the United States, but even in Blacksburg!</p>
	
	<p2>In fact if you  look at the charts here, over 81% of all college students in America, are considering going to trade school, due to fearing that AI might take over their jobs.</p2>

	<a>Don't even look at google, as 45% of all students taking a STEM Major are 9% more likely to drop out within the first year.</a>
